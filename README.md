<h2 id="quick-start">Quick Start :chart_with_upwards_trend:</h2>
Download this app in the Android/iOS app store or fork this project to do your modifications.

### Mobile and Wearable
We’re using Flutter (Dart language) since we’ll need to develop only once for Android, iOS, Web and Wearable platforms.

In order to develop/test using Apple Simulator/Android Emulator, you’ll need to Install IntelliJ (or Android Studio) 
and setup Xcode command line tools (if a mac user):

1. Install IntelliJ or Android studio > Preferences > Android SDK > Configure it.
2. Install Xcode > Preferences > Locations > Select command line tools.

> Selecting this command line tools will enable the option to run tests/develop against Simulator in IntelliJ/Android 
> Studio. Setting Android SDK up will enable the option to run tests/develop against Emulator  in IntelliJ/Android 
> Studio.

### Unit testing
All unit tests are being run against a Heroku machine as it is our PaaS.
